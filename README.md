## About

This project evaluates the robustness of Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEnt RL) via Energy-Based Normalizing Flows (EBFlow). While RL algorithms are typically tested in clean, idealized simulations, this work introduces realistic disturbances—including sensor corruption, action noise, and observation noise—using tools from the Robust Gym benchmark to assess generalization. 

In this project, I benchmarked performance against baseline RL policies and analyzed performance degradation and stability across perturbation regimes. By applying rigorous robustness tests to state-of-the-art methods, the project highlights key challenges and explores applicability in realistic and safety-critical control settings, informing efforts toward safe, reliable deployment in the real world.

##### The goal is to:
- Stress-test popular RL methods under real-world-inspired conditions.
- Diagnose weaknesses in MaxEnt RL.
- Guide the development of more robust, deployable learning algorithms.

Steps measured in units of 1e5. All experimental results are reproducible via scripts in this repo. See [Reproducing Figures](#reproducing-figures).

## Dependencies and Installation

- Python 3.9
- [Robust Gymnasium](https://github.com/SafeRL-Lab/Robust-Gymnasium)

Clone and enter the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sophiebroderick/RobustMEow
cd RobustnessMEow
```

Create and activate a new environment:
```bash
uv init meowrobust --python 3.9
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
bash setup.bash
uv sync
```

## Running Experiments

Both MEow and TD3 have been modified to output logs compatible with Robust Gym. Configuration files control environment settings, seeds, and training parameters.

**Example:** Run MEow on `AntRandom-v5`:
```bash
python meow_robust.py --config "config_meow_robust.yaml"
```

**Example:** Run TD3 on `AntRandom-v5`:
```bash
python td3_robust.py --config "config_td3_robust.yaml"
```

## Reproducing Figures

All raw data for figures can be found in the `/runs` directory.
To reproduce the evaluation plots run quick_plotter.py in the `/plots` directory
